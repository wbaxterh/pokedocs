Host-anywhere kit v1 (S1.7.1–S1.7.3): `pokedocs deploy init` is live with pluggable targets — `github-pages` scaffolds the production-proven Pages workflow (chromium cached for mermaid, `.nojekyll`, `--domain` writes the CNAME) and `docker` generates a maintained multi-stage Dockerfile (chromium builder, unprivileged non-root nginx runtime, `try_files`/404/copy-path derived from the configured `baseUrl`, `--build-arg POKEDOCS_URL` override), verified against a real container run. The preset now eliminates the baseUrl footgun: a production build with a localhost-like or example.com url prints a prominent warning, and `POKEDOCS_STRICT_URL=true` makes it a build error. Scaffolded configs read `POKEDOCS_URL`/`POKEDOCS_BASE_URL` from the environment.
